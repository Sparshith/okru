This is a ***Measure What Matters*** meets ***Elephant In The Brain*** meets ***Atomic Habits*** effort to use personal OKRs that track System Metrics and positively decieve our silly brains. You can set your quarterly OKRs, pre-commit metrics, estimate possible failure modes and follow your friends.

Checkout the issues and the kanban for this project!
